##**Knowledge about open source and Linux**

Don't worry if you know these 2 terms only. Also, it's fine if you have
never used Linux before this. I would advise you to come up with Debian
or debian based Linux distro [Ubuntu]. You can either dual-boot it or can
run it in virtual machines.

##**Knowledge about Linux Kernel and C**

It's fine if you are a beginner in C and don't have much knowledge about
Linux Kernel. We will help you with sending your first patch in the biggest
open source project written in C.

##**Knowledge about command line**

As far as you know what terminal is, you are done. Although little bit of Googling
won't hurt.

##**Setting up an environment for the workshop**

You will need linux-next code with email client to send your first patch
in the linux kernel. I have added a documentation for the same.
